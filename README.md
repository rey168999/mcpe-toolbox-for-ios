# MCPE Toolbox for iOS
This is the first *free* non-jailbreak mod menu hack client for Minecraft on iOS devices. With this shortcut, you can modify MCPE values (such as change anything in your options easily or edit your worlds) and you can have ability to enable or disable hacks.

Remember that it's always being worked on, and will consist of many updates. You can join the discord server or check the github for more detailed releases, updates, and changelog. Right now the github contains the only wikipedia page for the project! There's also a YouTube channel with videos on the progress/updates over the project.
